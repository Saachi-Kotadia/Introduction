Hi,

I am currently pursuing the Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) degree, where I am delving into diverse technologies. My keen interest lies in Java programming, which is an integral part of developing various software applications. I am enthusiastic about upskilling myself in this area, as I believe it will empower me to become a more proficient and adaptable IT professional.

Looking forward to learning more from my peers.
